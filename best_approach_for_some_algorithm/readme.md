  - fibonacci_number.cpp
  > We can find n'th term of [fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in **O(log(n))** time complexity by using this code.
  
  - get_all_factor.cpp
  > In time complexity of **sqrt(n)** we can find list of all factor of any number.
  
  - power_of_two_no.cpp
  > This is most used function function in competititve programming.
  > In this power function we can compute power of any two number in **O(log(n))** time complexity by using technique of [Binary Exponentation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/binary-exp.html).
